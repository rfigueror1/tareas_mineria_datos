A private IP address is an IP address that's reserved for internal use behind a router or other Network Address Translation (NAT) device, apart from the public.

Private IP addresses are in contrast to public IP addresses, which are public and can not be used within a home or business network.

Sometimes a private IP address is also referred to as a local IP address.
Which IP Addresses Are Private?

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) reserves the following IP address blocks for use as private IP addresses:

    10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
    172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
    192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

The first set of IP addresses from above allow for over 16 million addresses, the second for over 1 million, and over 65,000 for the last range.

Another range of private IP addresses is 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255, but those addresses are for Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) use only.

In 2012, the IANA allocated 4 million addresses of 100.64.0.0/10 for use in carrier-grade NAT environments.
Why Private IP Addresses Are Used

Instead of having devices inside a home or business network each use a public IP address, of which there's a limited supply, private IP addresses provide an entirely separate set of addresses that still allow access on a network but without taking up a public IP address space.

For example, let's consider a standard router on a home network. Most routers in homes and businesses across the globe, probably yours and your next door neighbor's, all have the IP address of 192.168.1.1, and assign 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, ... to the various devices that connect to it (via something called DHCP).

It doesn't matter how many routers use the 192.168.1.1 address, or how many dozens or hundreds of devices inside that network share IP addresses with users of other networks, because they aren't communicating with each other directly.

Instead, the devices in a network use the router to translate their requests through the public IP address, which can communicate with other public IP addresses and eventually to other local networks.

The hardware within a specific network that are using a private IP address can communicate with all the other hardware within the confines of that network, but will require a router to communicate with devices outside the network, after which the public IP address will be used for the communication.

For example, before landing on this page, your device (be it a computer, phone, or whatever), which uses a private IP address, requested this page through a router, which has a public IP address. Once the request was made and Lifewire responded to deliver the page, it was downloaded to your device through a public IP address before reaching your router, after which it got handed off to your private/local address to reach your device.

All the devices (laptops, desktops, phones, tablets, etc.) that are contained within private networks around the world can use a private IP address with virtually no limitation, which can't be said for public IP addresses.
